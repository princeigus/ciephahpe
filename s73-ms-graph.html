I'm looking at accessing the Microsoft Graph API to pull some data from a mailbox. You can play around with the API here (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer). For example, this request will return emails that have an attachment: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?$filter=hasAttachments eq true Using the PSMSGraph module (https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/psmsgraph/1.0.5.8) from /u/markekraus and following the quickstart guide (https. The Microsoft Graph explorer is a tool that lets you make requests and see responses against the Microsoft Graph. I realise this is probably annoyingly simple for some people here and I'm missing something obvious but I'm having trouble trying to build a string into a powershell MS Graph API request (assume all the code for auth token, etc. is working). This sample works: $intuneDeviceId = 'deadbeef-1234-1234-1234-deadbeef1234' $deviceCategoryReqBody = '{"@odata.id":"https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/deviceCategories/98769876-9876-9876-9876-9876543210"}' $patchDeviceReqBody. 
Explore Microsoft Graph, a developers' API platform to connect to the data that drives productivity. I'm very experienced with powershell, but I've never had a need to look into this before, but I do now. I'd like to further my knowledge of the MS Graph API as it relates to Azure AD authentication events. For example, download a list of 'at-risk users' daily or a list users who have successfully authenticated from overseas, etc. amp#x200B; Powershell gallery has several modules, but there's no real documentation per se, and i don't just want to experiment aimlessly here.

Hey there I'm trying to make an Alaxa skill that interacts with MS Graph, so far i've had little luck getting my standard Microsoft account to sign in, and looking through the documentation there seems to be multiple different node libraries for authenticating and calling the MS graph? Which one should i be using for authenticating and calling graph endpoints for standard accounts as well as work and school accounts?. Microsoft Graph exposes granular permissions that control the access that apps have to resources, like users, groups, and mail. As a developer, you decide which permissions for Microsoft Graph your app requests. I am in an honors first year college chemistry course. The TA's threw a powerpoint together with loads of technical terms, and somehow expect us to understand. How can I try to understand these.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks. What is Microsoft Graph In this article, we'll talk about Microsoft Graph APIs and will show you a quick preview of the essential features. This technology is growing up too fast so some existing features. I cannot seem to find any examples of connecting and querying the Microsoft Graph API from Powershell core. amp#x200B; Every example I seem to find has a dependency on Windows Forms or Powershell 5.1. amp#x200B; Has anyone seen or can share code for querying MS Graph from Powershell. What is Microsoft Graph API? Microsoft Graph API (Application Programming Interface) is the evolvement of Office 365 Unified API into a single stop for a cloud solution by exposing multiple Microsoft cloud service APIs through a single REST (Representational State Transfer) API endpoint. 
I'm writing a few functions for work as part of a "net health check" for Office 365 and Azure audit data we often pull for clients. Everything was going great last week, I dynamically build the application in Azure AD, request consent for the required permissions from the user, and get my token. This week, I'm getting the below error: Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.AdalServiceException: AADSTS650051: Application 'ltmy_appgt' is requesting permissions that are either.

Hello, I need to get some of the user data for a custom SPFX web part. I wonder which of the following is the best option. amp#x200B; 1. Using search. adding the profile fields as managed properties /refiners and use search to get the user information. 2. Using MS Graph, basically querying the user data using Graph services. amp#x200B; My take is that using search will be faster and I wont have to deal with the authentication / permission part of Graph but the downside Learn what is Microsoft Graph, how to use it and what are the new capabilities and data added We got a request from management to send an email to a user's manager (with photo attached), when user updates their photo on Office 365.

Is this in any way possible? Office 365 Graph is just a great way to add Office 365 integration into your application. You'll find many great information in the Office Dev Center to explain more all what is available. I was interested in adding Office 365 integration in a normal Windows .NET Service I want to make some excersizes for my students with some MS graphs. Anyone know of a simulator where I input a substance and get the MS spectrum. 3 weeks ago I was involved in a project combining Office 365, SharePoint Online and Microsoft Flow. One of the problem I had to solve 
Hello all, amp#x200B; So as you know in the recent past there have been many MFA issues in 365. And as such different techs have taken different paths to get people working when that happened. One of them is turning off MFA while microsoft got their stuff fixed. Well this also got me thinking about on boarding new users and potentially forgetting to turn on MFA, hey it happens. amp#x200B; So my question is this - Is there a way to set something up inside of 365 that sends out an alert.

Here's more on why this program should be in your toolbox. Good morning! Hopefully this is the right place to post. amp#x200B; I've been tasked with coming up with a way to let supervisors(non-technical) grant AD Group access to their team members for 2 different AD Groups - Either Group1, Group2, or None - not both. The AD Group membership actually controls access to other software via SSO, but that is out of scope for this discussion. This doesnt -need- to be real-time, but has to be within 24 hours, and I'd prefer real-time if it makes sense.
